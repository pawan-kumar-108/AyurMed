### Brief of the prototype project

The chatbot system detects the disease (currently limited disease like cold, fever, acidity, constipation, asthma, etc. are supported) based on the user’s prompt and suggest the best available resource/medicine from Ayurveda.

We have utilized OneAPI's toolkits for Data Analytics like Modin Pandas library and Intel's extension for PyTorch.

Used this model from hugging face: 

BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5

in order to create the RAG pipeline and top of that Intel® Xeon 4th Gen ® Scalable processor after creating a VM.


### Tech Stack

UI: React.js

ML libraries: Intel's Distribution of Modin, Intel's Optimization for XGBoost, Intel's Extension for Scikit-learn

Deployment: IDC (Intel Developer Cloud)
